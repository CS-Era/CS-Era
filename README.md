- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @CS-Era and I'm currently studying Computer Science.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Cyber Security and I hope to join this amazing field as soon as possible.
- Here you can find my latest Springer Publication made with my collegue Biagio Scotto di Covella, and the Professors Walter Balzano and Silvia Stranieri: https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-19945-5_22. In particular, we described how the Banker's Algorithm can optimise the traffic congestion problem in the VANETs networks.
