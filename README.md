- 👋 Hi, I’m @CS-Era and I'm currently studying Computer Science.
- 👀 I’m interested in Cyber Security and I hope to join this amazing field as soon as possible.
- 👨‍💻 I'm collaborating in a Research Team of my University (Federico II) guided by the Prof. W. Balzano (Operating Systems) and Prof. S. Stranieri (Fondamentals of Computer Science Programming).
- Here you can find my latest Springer Publication made with my colleague Biagio Scotto di Covella (biagioSc), and the Professors Walter Balzano and Silvia Stranieri: https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-19945-5_22. In particular, we described how the Banker's Algorithm can optimise the traffic congestion problem in the VANETs networks.
